# Truhlarna IS (Joinery Information System)
This web application was a project for the CS course BI-SP1 (Software project 1) at Czech Technical University in Prague.

The purpose of the course was to familiarize students with the process of creation a software project in a small team (of 4 people), emphasize the importance of documentation and introduce the basic principles of project management.

The project was ordered by real company (unfortunately can't disclose which).

**My role**: project leader

## Task
Build an IS (informatin system) for a Joinery to log the daily performance records of individual workers, so that the company could move prom current paper logs to unified system. The system should log who is working on what product for how many hours. In addition it should be able to log vacation, sick-days and national holiday.
From all the information it should be easy to generat a monthly report (e.g. PDF) and assigned resources report for customer for specific product.
