# Truhlarna IS (Joinery Information System)
This web application was a project for the CS course BI-SP1 (Software project 1) at Czech Technical University in Prague. The purpose of the course was to familiarize students with the process of creation a software project in a small team (of 4 people), emphasize the importance of documentation and introduce the basic principles of project management.

The project was ordered by real company (unfortunately can't disclose which).

My role: project leader
